I run a k3s cluster because I enjoy making my life unnecessarily complicated. Why use the cloud when I can spend hours debugging YAML in my own basement?

I published this repo so future-me can remember why things are broken and to help others avoid (or embrace) similar chaos.

Long story short: Renovate checks for updates, creates pull requests, I merge them, and ArgoCD takes care of the rest — because who doesn’t love fully automated, self-inflicted downtime?
